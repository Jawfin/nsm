This is a solution I found for the mouse sticking when having monitors arranged vertically instead of horizontally and forked. I ported it to C# WPF and added commandline arguments e.g. NonStickMouse.exe --rangex=2 --rangey=2 --hoplimit=30


# nsm
Non Stick Mouse. A simple app which allows the mouse to hop over the corners of multiple monitors in Windows 10.
